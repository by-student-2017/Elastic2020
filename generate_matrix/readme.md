## For `generate_matrix.py`

This script is designed to generate configuration matrices for various lattice configurations (LCs) based on a simplified theoretical model inspired by the publication:

> R. Golesorkhtabar, P. Pavone, J. Spitaler, P. Puschnig, and C. Draxl,  
> *ElaStic: A tool for calculating second-order elastic constants from first principles*,  
> Computer Physics Communications **184**, 1861 (2013).  
> [DOI link](https://exciting-code.org/elastic/)

### Disclaimer
The matrices generated are based on a simplified theoretical model and may differ from those presented in the original ElaStic publication. They are intended for educational and conceptual purposes. Future researchers are encouraged to refine and validate the model.

### Purpose

The script generates matrices that relate strain tensors to stress components for different lattice configurations. These matrices are used to estimate second-order elastic constants.

### Mathematical Background

#### Voigt Notation

In Voigt notation, the symmetric strain and stress tensors are represented as 6-component vectors:

- Strain tensor:
  $$\varepsilon = [\varepsilon_{11}, \varepsilon_{22}, \varepsilon_{33}, 2\varepsilon_{23}, 2\varepsilon_{13}, 2\varepsilon_{12}]$$

- Stress tensor:
  $$\sigma = [\sigma_{11}, \sigma_{22}, \sigma_{33}, \sigma_{23}, \sigma_{13}, \sigma_{12}]$$

This notation simplifies the representation of second-order tensors in matrix form.

#### Matrix Construction

For each lattice configuration (LC), a set of strain tensors is defined. For each strain tensor $$\( \varepsilon \)$$ and each stress component $$\( \sigma_i \)$$ (where $$\( i = 1 \)$$ to $$\( 6 \)$$), the row vector is constructed as:

$$[\varepsilon_i \cdot 1, \varepsilon_i \cdot 2, \ldots, \varepsilon_i \cdot N]$$

where $$\( N \)$$ is the number of independent elastic tensor components for the given LC.

### Usage
```
python3 generate_matrix.py
```
Run the script to generate matrices for all supported lattice configurations. Each matrix is printed to the console and written to a file named `python3-code.txt` in the format:

### Future Work

The current implementation uses a simplified model that does not fully capture the complexity of elastic tensor calculations as presented in the ElaStic paper. Specifically:

- The original ElaStic paper and its accompanying code fully support only the following lattice configurations:
  - **CI**: Cubic I structure (space group numbers 207–230)
  - **CII**: Cubic II structure (space group numbers 195–206)
  - **HI**: Hexagonal I structure (space group numbers 177–194)
  - **HII**: Hexagonal II structure (space group numbers 168–176)
  - **RI**: Rhombohedral I structure (space group numbers 149–167)

- The following configurations are not fully implemented in the original ElaStic code and are included here for conceptual completeness:
  - **RII**: Rhombohedral II structure (space group numbers 143–148)
  - **TI**: Tetragonal I structure (space group numbers 89–142)
  - **TII**: Tetragonal II structure (space group numbers 75–88)
  - **O**: Orthorhombic structure (space group numbers 16–74)
  - **M**: Monoclinic structure (space group numbers 3–15)
  - **N**: Triclinic structure (space group numbers 1–2)

  - **Crystal Symmetry**: T[Uploading ElaStic_Analyze_Stress…]()
he model does not incorporate symmetry constraints specific to each lattice configuration, which are essential for reducing the number of independent elastic constants and ensuring physical consistency.
  - **Tensor Transformation Rules**: Proper transformation rules for strain and stress tensors under symmetry operations are not applied, which may lead to incorrect matrix formulations.
  - **Ab Initio Validation**: The generated matrices have not been validated against results from first-principles calculations (e.g., DFT), which is crucial for confirming their accuracy.

These configurations are not yet validated against the original ElaStic methodology and may produce results that differ from expected physical behavior.

Future improvements may include:
- Implementing symmetry-aware matrix generation using group theory.
- Applying correct tensor transformation rules based on crystal class.
- Comparing and calibrating the generated matrices with ab initio data from ElaStic or similar tools.
